# Overview

`metis` aim is to implement [Notation3](https://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/n3/) conforming to the API of [`sophia`](https://github.com/pchampin/sophia_rs/).

# Features

- Serializer for [Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/) (WIP).
- Parser for Turtle (WIP).
- Parser for Notation3 (not usabel, yet).

# License

For now this software is licensed under CeCILL-C to align with `sophia`.
Once `sophia` is split into `sophia-core` with a [more permissive license](https://github.com/pchampin/sophia_rs/issues/23#issuecomment-565092486) this project will follow that.
